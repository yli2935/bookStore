## Frontend Developer test for Blazesoft

Using React to develop a bookstore.

1. It should be a single page with book details. The main page should have a book list showing book name, price, category, and a delete button at the end for each book. There should be an add button at the top so the user can add a book.

2. Once you click the "add a book" button, it should pop up a page, letting the user add a book (name, price, category, and description).

3. The book should be clickable. If the user clicks the book, it will show a popup page, allowing the user to modify the book name, price, category, and description. After modification, the book details should be updated on the main page.

4. Once the delete button is clicked, the book should be deleted from the main page.

There is no need for a backend; just use an array to store the book list.
